Android EmojiCompat Sample (Kotlin)
===================================

This sample demonstrates usage of EmojiCompat support library. You can use this library to prevent
your app from showing missing emoji characters in the form of tofu (â–¡).

This demo is based upon Google's [user-interface-samples](https://github.com/android/user-interface-samples)
but has been modified to add a View that manages its own StaticLayout for use with
StaticLayout.draw(canvas).
